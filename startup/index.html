			<h2> Our Plans!</h2>

		<p class="project__description">
		A one stop platform for gamers. Firstly We aim to provide latest news and updates of upcoming mainstream games. Interviews with developers, Q&A session as well. Also to provide tips, guides and help for new players. Next, we want to help everyone decide on what type of setup to build by giving opinions and reviews on hardwares in the market. And last, we aim to create a hub where gamers can make friends and hangout. Gamers can share anything adn evrything under the sun with friends, not necessarily related to gaming.
